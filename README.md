# testing-javascript-exercises

#### Welcome to Testing Javascript workshop!

Here we will dive into some basis
and will try to make our own implementation of testing tools 🤓

Run `yarn` to install all needed dependencies
Run `yarn test:watch` to ensure everything is working right

###### Here we have three main folders:

`src/tests/examples` - some examples that will help me to tell about each feature

`src/tests/exercises` - main folder with exercises where you will work

`src/tests/final` - my own way to resolve the task

###### You can notice comments in exercise with different emojii:

👨‍💻 - coding time

‍✅ - check or notice something in console

🔧 - fix

⭐ - additional part that you can skip or do if you have enough time

💡 - hint or idea for resolving
