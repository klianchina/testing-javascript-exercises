### Welcome to Testing Javascript workshop!

Here we will dive into some basis
and will try to make our own implementation of testing tools 🤓

### Requirements

The project is required `yarn`

It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager. You can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

### Before we go

- Run `yarn` to install all needed dependencies
- Run `yarn test:watch` to ensure everything is working right

### Important info

###### Here we have three main folders:

`src/tests/examples` - some examples that will help me to tell about each feature

`src/tests/exercises` - main folder with exercises where you will work

`src/tests/final` - my own way to resolve the task

###### You can notice comments in exercise with different emojii:
